There was once a king who ruled over the land, and he was unmerciful and ruled ruthlessly. 

However, one day, a young boy challenged the king to a duel. The king laughed at the child and agreed, assuming it would be an easy fight.

(Christopher Kennedy)The king, a master swordsman, looked at the boy with pity. He said, "I'm sorry I have to do this" as he lunged. But then something rare happened. In the kings cockiness, he stepped too hard, and stumbled on a rock. The sword fell out of his hand as he cought himself, and the boy took his opportunity.
Unfortunately for the boy, the foolhardy king regained his balance and parried the boy's meek attack. The boy, seeing his chances dwindle, shuddered and ran back to his moma. His mother, a ferocious woman was livid at the sight, seeing his buy weep. She took his sword and and brisked towards the terrified crowd. The king, blind in his anavailing victory did not see the mother approach and was stabbed multiple times by the mother. Since thenn, the mother took control of the kingdom and one terrible ruler was replaced by another.
