There was once a king who ruled over the land, and he was unmerciful and ruled ruthlessly. 

However, one day, a young boy challenged the king to a duel. The king laughed at the child and agreed, assuming it would be an easy fight.

(Christopher Kennedy)The king, a master swordsman, looked at the boy with pity. He said, "I'm sorry I have to do this" as he lunged. But then something rare happened. In the kings cockiness, he stepped too hard, and stumbled on a rock. The sword fell out of his hand as he cought himself, and the boy took his opportunity.
